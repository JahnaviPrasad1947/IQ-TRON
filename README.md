# IQ-TRON
IQ testing app

Idea for Microsoft Hackathon 2.0 at Lovely Professional University, Phagwara.

Idea :
           IQ-TRON is an android app that calculates its user’s intelligence quotient using Machine learning.
IQ of a human being is calculated by the formula 
            (Mental age) / (Physical age) * 100
The Physical age is given as input by the user.
The mental age is calculated by the app with help of algorithms, which are used worldwide by many famous testing agencies.
We did our base work and collected the testing algorithms from Mensa international.
We will build the app during MS HACKS 2.0 with help of Microsoft Windows SDK (Software development kits) and integrate it with the testing data we acquired.
 IQ-TRON will help an individual assess his IQ without any physical presence of a      representative from the testing corporation.
	What makes it special ???
IQ-TRON is a 'computer adaptive testing app'.
With help of machine learning it can adapt itself to user IQ standards and produce questions accordingly.
if previous answer was right it gives a slightly harder question next.
it previous answer is wrong it decreases its standard slightly.
in this manner we can exactly pinpoint the IQ standard of the user.

	Features we want to build

Virtual assistant to guide through testing process.
           Comfortable User Interface, so that everyone can test themselves with ease.
          Quizzes that use complex figures.
          Time limited tests.
          Above 95% accuracy. 
	Constraints 
          Experience: we are not professionals and are seeking to learn a lot from this  
                            Amazing event.
         Time: It takes days if not months to make a full pledged IQ Calculator, but we    
                  Promise to make a working prototype in the stipulated 36 hours.
